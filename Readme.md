!!! For instructors !!!
Here you can find the codes *after* each particular video. 
It should help when there is a question.

====== Minor mistakes that I come accross ======

Found nothing critical upon review;

* 3.3.2.Demonstration - Windows Forms Events; 

When BirthDatePicker control's properties are set, the voice says the Minimum date is set to 1990's, although in the video it is set to 1900. 
The next video continues from 1990 as selection.

Probably someone 3.3.3.Input Validations will point this out.

* 3.4.1.User Controls - Part 1

When Date String Format is given, the time format is given as hh/mm/dd instead of hh/mm/ss, which causes to show the "day" in place of "second" in the video.
This second info is not somewhere critical. In the video just it is seen like this.

* 4.4.File System as Data Storage Unit Series

This video was too long and cut into 5 pieces. Therefore each piece does not build successfully until completion of the Part 5.
Not a bug, it is a feature.

* 6.1.2.Events and Delegates

In the beginning, when the "6.1.2.CalculatorForm.rar" form is added, the video shows no error, although two additional libraries should be added into the references.
I included an additional readme file inside "CalculatorForm.rar" file. That readme file should be added in the comments, as an instructor note.
A version of the working solution where these libraries added is added as well with the name "6.1.2.CalculatorApp (Just After Empty Calculator Form Added).rar".
I do not recommend adding this video into the lecture.
